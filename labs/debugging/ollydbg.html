<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
In this lab, we'll use OllyDbg to figure out a password that will
let us access protected functionality in a very simple
program. Double click the Lab1.exe file on the desktop to run the
program. You will see that it gives you three attempts to type a
working password, then exits. We're going to use OllyDbg to observe
the operation of this program in order to discover what password(s)
will work to get us past the check.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Getting started</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
First, launch ollydbg from your desktop icon. You'll see a
collection of several viewports and a large number of buttons. The
interface has a fairly steep learning curve for more advanced uses,
but for the basic operations we'll use today it should be easy to
operate. For a more in-depth exploration of ollydbg's features and
UI, take a look at this chapter in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=DhuTduZ-pc4C&lpg=PA181&ots=3dkPSpSagz&dq=ollydbg%20interface&pg=PA182#v=onepage&q=ollydbg%20interface&f=false">Practical Malware Analysis</a>.

<h4 id="sec-1-1-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.1.1</span> Start the program in ollydbg</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-1-1">
<p>
To start the program, you can either just run it as before and
    attach, or you can launch it from ollydbg. In this case, use the
    File-&gt;Open menu item to launch the program. Ollydbg will stop at
    the program's entry point and wait for instructions from you. If
    you press the play button ollydbg will run the program without
    stopping it until either a breakpoint or an exception occurs.

<h3 id="sec-1-2"><span class="section-number-3">1.2</span> Finding the important parts</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Almost all of the art of reverse engineering boils down to finding
clever ways to avoid the painful work of reading reams of assembly
code. Even a tiny program like this would take hours or days to
fully comprehend if you had to figure out all of the details about
what it does. Fortunately, we don't really care about that. What
we want is much simpler - to locate the password check and figure
out how to get past it and see what happens on the other side.
</p>

<p>
To do that, we'll use the program's behavior to shortcut the
analysis problem and land right where we need to be. The program
seems to behave in this way:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Ask user for a password
</li>
<li>Verify correctness of the password
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If it is correct, do something we haven't seen yet
</li>
<li>If not, give the user two more attempts and then exit.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
There are several points during this process that could be very
helpful to us. We'll use two methods to locate the relevant
code. The first and most obvious clue is probably the message
that's displayed when the password doesn't match. We can use
ollydbg to tell the program to stop when a piece of memory is
accessed, so we will find that message in the program's memory and
put a breakpoint on it. The second method is to take advantage of
the fact that the program stops when it's waiting for our
input. We'll run it until it's waiting for input, then break into
it with ollydbg and trace the stack up to see what function is
called to get input. From there we will find the password check
function by tracing.
</p>
</div>

<ol class="org-ol"><li><a id="sec-1-2-0-1" name="sec-1-2-0-1"></a>Use ollydbg's analysis features<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-0-1">
<p>
Right-click in the memory window (bottom left part of the screen)
and pick "Search for &gt; All referenced strings". This will open a
window with an entry for each string reference ollydbg could find
in the program. Scan through the list to find the "Access Denied"
string, then press Enter to go to that instruction in the
disassembler view. At this point, it is probably pretty obvious
that we're close to the main part of the program that does the
password check. Hold that thought, we're going to go through a
couple of other ways to find this point before we continue.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="sec-1-2-0-2" name="sec-1-2-0-2"></a>Using program's built-in wait points<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-0-2">
<p>
Another way to find the piece of code we want is to recognize
that the program is going to get a piece of string data from the
system, and then use it later to check the password. Since it has
to stop while we type our password, we can simply let it get to
that point, then see where it is in the debugger and set a
breakpoint.
</p>

<p>
Go ahead and push the restart button (looks like two triangles
pointing left) to reload the program. Press play again and wait
for it to ask for the password, then go to ollydbg and press the
pause button.
</p>

<p>
In order to find the part of the code we want, we now need to
figure out what function originally called the input
function. First, open the threads window in ollydbg by pressing
the "T" button. Find the main thread (look in the leftmost column
for "Main"). Click that thread, then press Enter to follow the
address in the disassembler.
</p>

<p>
You will now be looking at the main thread with all views. Go
over to the stack view (bottom right corner). This displays all
data on the program's stack, which includes the return addresses
for each currently active function call (exactly what we
want!). There are a large number of functions currently
active. Here's where it's important to get the big picture in
mind, which is that we're looking for application code specific
to the program we're working on. For that reason, we will just
scroll through the stack until we find the first instance of a
return to code that's in lab1.exe. Scroll down and look at each
line that starts with "RETURN from" to find the first one that
has lab1 in the name (e.g. "RETURN from msvcrt.7573987B to
lab1.00401a5e").
</p>

<p>
Looking at this function, you should see the same interesting
code we saw before.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="sec-1-2-0-3" name="sec-1-2-0-3"></a>Memory breakpoint<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-0-3">
<p>
Sometimes the memory we're searching for doesn't come up
automatically in ollydbg's analysis. In that case, we'll have to
search for it directly. 
</p>

<p>
Ollydbg allows you to search for data in segments of memory
allocated to the process. If you have a segment open in the dump,
disassembler, or stack, you can just right click or press Ctrl+B
in that section to search the currently visible memory
segment. However, most of the time you probably won't know which
part of the process's memory has the data you want. In order to
search the entire process, you need to open the memory map
window. To do this, press the blue "M" button (or press
Alt-M). You are now looking at the memory map, which lists all of
the memory in use by the process along with various bits of data
for each mapped region.
</p>

<p>
To search for a string, press Ctrl+B in the memory map window,
then type the string you're looking for in the appropriate
box. In this case, we're looking for an "Access denied" which is
probably plain ASCII, so enter that into the top box.
</p>

<p>
Ollydbg will search through the mapped memory in order and list
all matches. When you get a match, it will open it in the dump
window. You should see your string there. Right click the first
byte and select "Breakpoint &gt; Memory". You can just click OK on
the dialog that opens up to enter breakpoint details. Now click
play on the debugger and type an incorrect password.
</p>

<p>
Ollydbg stops when the string is accessed, which is deep in a
call stack to write text to the console. Make sure you're in the
main thread and use the stack walking technique again from before
to find where in lab1.exe this call was made. You're now in the
same place you found with the other methods.
</p>
</div>
</li></ol>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-3"><span class="section-number-3">1.3</span> Reversing the password</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-3">
<p>
Now we're ready to start digging into the actual password recovery
portion of the lab. We've found the point in the code where the
password result is checked. What we need to do now is use that
entry point to find the actual code that does the password check
and analyze it to see what we need to use for a password in order
to gain access.
</p>

<p>
You should have your debugger paused in the function we found
earlier (if not, repeat one of the above methods to find it
again). Ollydbg will have already analyzed the code to find
function boundaries for you. If you look to the left of the
disassembly listing, you'll see a vertical line that ends on the
<code>RETN</code> instruction and goes upward in the listing. Scroll up until
you find the end of that line, which will be at a <code>PUSH EBP</code>
instruction. This is the entry point of the function. Set a
breakpoint here and restart the program.
</p>

<p>
After you press play, the program will stop at your
breakpoint. You can now step through the code and watch what the
program does at various points. We want to see which function
calls are I/O related and which are password validation related,
so we don't want to descend into them yet. We'll use the <code>Step
    over</code> button (also <code>F8</code>) to do this. Press <code>F8</code> a few times until
the program seems to stop responding. It is now waiting for your
input. Type a password and press <code>Enter</code>.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-3-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-3-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.3.1</span> Reading assembly</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-1">
<p>
Because you used the step over function, ollydbg will run the
entire input call before pausing the program again. We're now at
the next step after the <code>fgets</code> call. This is where we really want
to start paying attention to what happens. Press <code>F8</code> again until
you reach a <code>CALL</code> instruction.
</p>

<p>
If you look at this <code>CALL</code>, you'll see that it takes the string as
an argument (it is at the top of the stack in the stack window),
and its return value is used to decide how to branch right
afterward. Use the arrow keys to navigate down a few instructions
to find the <code>JZ</code> instruction. This instruction is a jump that will
happen only if the zero condition flag is set by the previous
<code>TEST</code> instruction. When this instruction is highlighted, you'll
see an arrow that appears to the left showing where the jump will
land if it happens. In this case, it stops at a <code>PUSH</code> instruction
which loads the address of our "Access denied" string. From this,
we can deduce that a return of zero from the function we're
stopped at means the password check failed, so our password check
probably happens in or below this function.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-3-2">
<p>
In order to retrieve the password, we need to watch how it is
checked. Press <code>F7</code> to enter the function we're stopped on.
</p>

<p>
Now that we've found a point very close to the target, we should
set a breakpoint on it and note the address. Press <code>F2</code> to set a
breakpoint, then press <code>:</code> and type a name you'll remember for
the function (something like 'check-password' works). You can use
this later to find this location again.
</p>

<p>
Press <code>F7</code> until you get to the first <code>CMP</code> (for CoMPare)
instruction. If you look in the little space between the
disassembly view and the memory dump view, you'll see that
ollydbg is helpfully decoding that 0x67 into the ASCII letter
'g'. This <code>CMP</code> instruction is taking the first byte of the
argument (which is the password you typed) and comparing it to
the letter 'g'.
</p>

<p>
Press <code>F7</code> again to get to the <code>JE</code> instruction. <code>JE</code> means Jump
if Equal, so this jump will happen only if the previous
comparison came out equal. If you look at the target of the jump,
it's just a couple of instructions further down and looks very
much like the little block of code we just executed. If the jump
is not taken, you can see that the <code>EAX</code> register will be set to
zero and the code will jump to a different location. Arrow down
to that <code>JMP</code> instruction to see what happens. Based on this
analysis, we can conclude that the first character of our
password probably needs to be 'g'.
</p>

<p>
Continue in this way until you have recovered the entire
password, then run the program outside of the debugger to verify
that you have it right.

<h3 id="sec-1-4"><span class="section-number-3">1.4</span> The lazy way: patching</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-4">
<p>
Sometimes we don't really have to figure out what the password
is. If the program is not designed well, it's easier to just patch
over the password check and skip it entirely. That's what we're
going to do now.
</p>

<p>
Restart the program in ollydbg and navigate to the password
checking function. If you made a label, you can right click in the
disassembly window and select "Search for &gt; Names", then scan down
the list until you find your label. Click it and press <code>Enter</code> to
go there. If not, you can go there using the breakpoints window
(opened with the blue 'B' button) by selecting the breakpoint and
pressing <code>Enter</code>.
</p>

<p>
We know from before that our password check fails if this function
returns zero. Knowing that, we can just change this function so
that it always returns 1, and we should be able to access the
hidden features without ever figuring out a valid password. To do
this, go down to the end of the function where the <code>RETN</code>
instruction is. In the standarc C calling convention, the return
value of a function is put into the <code>EAX</code> register before the
function returns. Remember from earlier that an incorrect letter
in the password made the function place zero in <code>EAX</code> just before
jumping to the end and returning. If we change the instruction
that writes to <code>EAX</code> so that it puts a 1 there instead, we can
cause the call to succeed as long as our first letter is <i>not</i>
part of the password! 
</p>

<p>
Navigate to the fist <code>CMP</code> instruction, then down to the <code>MOV</code>
instruction below it that zeros <code>EAX</code>. Double click that
instruction and change the zero to a 1, then click
"Assemble". Ollydbg will automatically generate the appropriate
machine code for you and patch the memory accordingly. Now press
play and enter a password that starts with the wrong letter. You
have patched the binary to bypass the password check.

<p>
The main objective of most reverse engineering work is to find
what you want without getting bogged down hand tracing heaps of
assembly code and data structures. We used several techniques in
ollydbg in this lab to find and bypass a password check, with very
little actual code tracing.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-1">
<p>
Use clues from the program you're debugging to get close to the
piece of code you want to find. In our case, we used strings that
we knew were accessed nearby, and we used the fact that the
program had to block while waiting for input to get the password.

<li>Use ollydbg's analysis features to look for references to
interesting data (<code>Search for</code> &gt; <code>All referenced strings</code>)
</li>
<li>Use the program's blocking behavior to land us near the
function, then follow the call stack back to code we care
about.
</li>
<li>Search the program's memory for data we know is used near our
point of interest, then set memory breakpoints on it.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-2">
<p>
Sometimes you can get a program to do what you want with a very
simple patch. Ollydbg makes on-the-fly patching very easy with
its built-in assembler. The main issue with patching is to ensure
that your patch fits in the space you have available - you can't
move things in a binary without a <i>lot</i> of work, so you have to
work within the constraints of what's already there.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-5-3">
<p>
If you need to understand an algorithm, there is really no
alternative other than to trace it. We traced the password
checking algorithm in this lab to determine what password would
unlock the program. Real-life tracing is typically much harder
than this, but works on basically the same principles: Single
step through the code and keep track of what it's doing.
